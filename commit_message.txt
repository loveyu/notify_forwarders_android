fix: Improve quick send logic with enhanced error handling and UX

- Remove intermediate status notifications during send process, use toast only
- Show error notifications only when send operations fail
- Add detailed network error handling with HTTP status codes
- Implement NetworkResult sealed class for better error management
- Add specific error messages for different network failure types:
  - Connection failures
  - Timeout errors
  - Host resolution errors
  - HTTP status code errors
- Enhanced error reporting for clipboard and image send operations
- Maintain foreground service notification without frequent updates
- Improved user experience with cleaner notification management

Technical improvements:
- Clipboard content now read in foreground thread for immediate feedback
- Image processing remains in background for optimal performance
- All send operations fully asynchronous with proper error handling
- Server address validation before any network operations
- Enhanced button styling with elevation effects and better color schemes
- Complete error handling with detailed user notifications

API Documentation:
- Added comprehensive REST API endpoint documentation
- Included request/response examples for all endpoints
- Documented timeout settings and configuration options
